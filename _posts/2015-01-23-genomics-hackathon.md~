title: Data Carpentry Genomics and Asssessment Hackathon

## Announcing a Data Carpentry Genomics and Assessment Hackathon

Through the support of [SESYNC](https://www.sesync.org), [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org) and 
[iPlant](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org) we are 
holding a hackathon for the development of lessons for a Genomics Data Carpentry and to develop
assessment for these lessons as well as an assessment framework for all Data Carpentry lessons. 

We would love to have the participation of people working in genomics or bioinformatics, those involved in 
training in this domain, those working in assessment, or any others who are interested in helping to shape the curriculum.
We aim to assemble a diverse and interdisciplinary group of scientists, educators, and developers, encompassing various 
levels of experience and a broad set of skills and encourage applications from anyone interested. 

We're very excited about this event and the opportunity to develop lessons targeting genomics researchers and build
assessment in to the curriculum. Please apply to participate!

If you are wondering if you should apply to participate in this hackathon or have any questions, please get in touch
